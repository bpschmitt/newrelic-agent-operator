# newrelic-agent-operator
<strong>newrelic-agent-operator</strong> is an implementation of a Kubernetes [Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator), that manages auto-instrumentation of the workloads using New Relic APM agents.

## Description
Customers expect the APM agent deployment process to be straightforward and hassle-free. They prefer agents that are easy to install and configure. The idea behind <strong>newrelic-agent-operator</strong> is to provide easy and efficient installation to the users. It uses
* Kubernetest operator to create required custom resource for the agent installation. It creates <strong>newrelic-instrumentation</strong> 
  resource.
* It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),which provide a reconcile function responsible for 
  synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.  
* Init containers that executes required one-time New Relic agent setup in application pods.
* Adding annotation ```instrumentation.newrelic.com/inject-<python>: "true"``` in application deployment yaml does the magic. This 
  annotation helps to trigger language specific installation steps as part of the init container.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) or [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

### Update newrelic-agent-operator
1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/newrelic-agent-operator:tag
```

2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/newrelic-agent-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
Undeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

## Things to consider
* Currently, <strong>newrelic-agent-operator</strong> supports instrumentation for [Python](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration/), [Java](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-java/), [Node.js](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-nodejs/) and [.NET](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-net/).
* [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) is required to be presented on cluster before starting newrelic-agent-operator
